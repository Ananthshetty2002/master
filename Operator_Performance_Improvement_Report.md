---

### Action 1.3: Four Points by Sheraton LAX - Emergency Restock
**DEADLINE: December 12, 2025 (2 days)**

**Problem Identified:**
This location has **316 out-of-stock items** - more than DOUBLE any other location. This represents approximately $25,000-$30,000 in lost monthly sales.

**Root Cause Investigation Required:**
Before restocking, you must determine WHY this location has such severe stock-outs:
- Is the kiosk being serviced on schedule?
- Is there a fulfillment/picking issue at the warehouse?
- Is demand higher than anticipated?
- Is there theft/security issues?

**Specific Actions Required:**

**Phase 1: Emergency Restock (Dec 11-12)**
1. Pull stock report for this location's TOP 50 sellers (from transaction history)
2. Prepare emergency restock order with 2x normal quantities
3. Deliver and fully stock by end of day December 12
4. Place signage: "Fully Restocked - More Selection Available"

**Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (Dec 13-14)**
1. Interview location contact to understand the issue
2. Review service schedule - are you visiting frequently enough?
3. Check route efficiency - is this location getting skipped?
4. Verify kiosk functionality - is payment system working properly?

**Phase 3: Prevention (Dec 15 ongoing)**
1. Increase service frequency from current schedule
2. If high-demand location, upgrade to "Tier 1" priority service
3. Implement weekly stock level audits for next 4 weeks
4. Set automated alerts in Odoo when stock falls below 30% of par

**Your Action Steps:**
1. **December 11 AM**: Call location manager to explain you identified stock issues and are fixing them
2. **December 11 PM**: Prepare emergency restock order
3. **December 12**: Deliver and fully restock personally (inspect kiosk condition)
4. **December 13**: Root cause meeting with location contact
5. **December 15**: Submit written plan to prevent recurrence

**Expected Impact:**
- Recover $25,000-$30,000 in monthly sales
- Improve location relationship and contract renewal likelihood
- Prevent customer dissatisfaction and competitive threats

**Success Metric:** Four Points LAX stock-outs reduced to <50 items by December 31

## SECTION 2: HIGH-PRIORITY ACTIONS - WEEK 1-2 IMPLEMENTATION

### Action 2.1: Fresh Food Category Overhaul
**DEADLINE: December 20, 2025**

**Problem Identified:**
- 1,091 fresh food items currently out of stock (highest category)
- $80,330 in fresh food waste
- This contradiction indicates wrong products, wrong locations, or wrong quantities

**Analysis:**
High stock-outs suggest demand EXCEEDS supply, but high waste suggests you're stocking items that don't sell. The combination indicates poor product-location fit.

**Specific Actions Required:**

**Step 1: Identify Fresh Food Winners vs. Losers (Dec 11-12)**

Run this analysis in your transaction data:
- Which fresh food items have >90% sell-through rate?
- Which fresh food items have >30% waste rate?
- Which locations have highest fresh food sales?
- Which locations have highest fresh food waste?

**Step 2: Create Location Tiers for Fresh Food (Dec 13-14)**

**Tier A Locations** (High fresh food sales, low waste):
- Stock FULL fresh food assortment
- Deliver 3x per week
- Higher par levels
- Examples: Major hotels, office buildings

**Tier B Locations** (Moderate fresh food sales):
- Stock TOP 20 fresh food SKUs only
- Deliver 2x per week  
- Standard par levels
- Examples: Mid-size hotels, smaller offices

**Tier C Locations** (Low fresh food sales, high waste):
- Stock only TOP 5-10 fresh food SKUs
- Deliver 1x per week
- Minimal par levels
- Consider discontinuing fresh food entirely if waste continues

**Step 3: Implement Changes (Dec 15-20)**

1. Notify warehouse of new fresh food SKU allocations by location
2. Update Odoo with location-specific fresh food SKUs
3. Adjust par levels in system
4. Brief delivery drivers on new protocols

**Your Action Steps:**
1. **Dec 11**: Extract fresh food sales and waste data from reports
2. **Dec 12**: Categorize all 155 locations into Tiers A, B, C
3. **Dec 13**: Determine SKU mix for each tier
4. **Dec 14**: Update Odoo system with new configurations
5. **Dec 15-17**: Communicate changes to warehouse and drivers
6. **Dec 18**: Begin implementation
7. **Dec 20**: Review early results, make adjustments

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce fresh food waste by $20,000-$25,000 per quarter
- Increase fresh food sales by $15,000-$20,000 per quarter
- Combined swing: $35,000-$45,000 improvement

**Success Metric:** 
- Fresh food waste reduced to <$20,000/month by February
- Fresh food stock-outs reduced to <300 items by January

### Action 2.2: Bottom-Tier Location Performance Review
**DEADLINE: December 23, 2025**

**Problem Identified:**
**119 locations (77%)** generated less than $20,000 in sales over the entire 3-month period. Some locations generated less than $1,000 total.

**Financial Reality:**
Assuming typical micro market operating costs:
- Inventory cost: ~65% of sales
- Labor (your time): ~15-20% per location
- Equipment, supplies, fees: ~10%
- **Break-even**: Approximately $15,000-$18,000 per quarter minimum

**Locations generating <$5,000/quarter are likely LOSING MONEY.**

**Specific Actions Required:**

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Dec 11-13)**

For bottom 30 locations, gather:
1. Installation date (are they new and ramping up?)
2. Contracted minimum sales or fees
3. Your actual time spent servicing (hours/month)
4. Any special circumstances (hospital, seasonal, etc.)
5. Current contract end date

**Phase 2: Location Categorization (Dec 14-15)**

**Category A - Keep & Grow:**
- New locations (<180 days old) showing growth trend
- Special contracts with guaranteed fees regardless of sales
- Strategic locations (leads to bigger contracts, market presence)
- Action: Increase investment, try 60-day boost program

**Category B - Keep & Maintain:**
- Low sales but very low service costs (clustered with other locations)
- Stable, not growing but profitable at low level
- Action: Maintain current service, monitor quarterly

**Category C - Intervention Required:**
- Mature locations with declining sales
- High service cost relative to revenue
- Action: 90-day improvement plan or exit

**Category D - Immediate Exit:**
- Locations open >1 year with <$3,000 quarterly sales
- Cannot possibly be profitable
- Action: Begin contract exit process

**Phase 3: Action on Category C & D Locations (Dec 16-23)**

**For Category C** (Intervention - example: 20 locations):
1. Site visit to diagnose issues
2. 90-day improvement plan with specific targets
3. Marketing push (signage, promotions, staff outreach)
4. Monthly reviews
5. Exit if no improvement by March 31

**For Category D** (Exit - example: 10 locations):
1. Review contracts for exit clauses
2. Schedule meeting with location decision-maker
3. Offer to remove equipment or convert to consignment model
4. Execute exit by January 31
5. Redeploy equipment to higher-opportunity locations

**Your Action Steps:**
1. **Dec 11-13**: Complete data collection for bottom 30 locations
2. **Dec 14**: Categorize each location (A/B/C/D)
3. **Dec 15**: Create specific plans for each category
4. **Dec 16-20**: Schedule and conduct Category C intervention meetings
5. **Dec 21-23**: Initiate Category D exit conversations
6. **Dec 31**: Submit final categorization and action plan to management

**Expected Impact:**
- Eliminate 5-10 unprofitable locations, saving $15,000-$25,000/quarter in service costs
- Focus resources on profitable/growth locations
- Free up 20-30 hours/month of your time for high-value activities
- Redeploy equipment to locations with higher potential

**Success Metric:**
- All locations profiled and categorized by Dec 15
- 90-day plans in place for all Category C locations by Dec 23
- At least 5 Category D location exits initiated by Dec 31

## SECTION 3: MEDIUM-PRIORITY ACTIONS - MONTH 1 IMPLEMENTATION

### Action 3.1: Implement Profitable Inventory Methodology
**DEADLINE: January 15, 2026**

**Current Problem:**
You're tracking sales revenue, but not tracking TRUE PROFITABILITY per product when waste is factored in. Some "top sellers" may actually be unprofitable.

**Example:**
- Haagen Dazs Ice Cream Bars
  - Revenue: ~$54,000 (combined variants)
  - Waste cost: ~$12,600 (combined)
  - Gross margin: ~35% = $18,900
  - **Net after waste**: $18,900 - $12,600 = **$6,300**
  - **True margin: Only 11.6%** (vs. 35% without waste factored)

**Specific Actions Required:**

**Step 1: Create Profitability Spreadsheet (Jan 2-5)**

Build Excel/Google Sheets with columns:
1. Product Code
2. Product Name  
3. Total Revenue (from sales reports)
4. Units Sold
5. Average Price
6. Cost per Unit (from product cost report)
7. Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS)
8. Gross Margin %
9. Waste Cost (from waste reports)
10. Net Profit After Waste
11. True Net Margin %
12. **Profitability Rating** (A/B/C/D)

**Step 2: Analyze and Rate Products (Jan 6-8)**

**Rating System:**
- **A-Grade**: True margin >25%, low waste, high velocity
- **B-Grade**: True margin 15-25%, moderate waste
- **C-Grade**: True margin 5-15%, needs watching
- **D-Grade**: True margin <5% or NEGATIVE - discontinue candidates

**Step 3: Take Action on Ratings (Jan 9-15)**

**For D-Grade Products:**
- Immediate discontinuation review
- If brand requirement (customer expects it), negotiate better pricing or find alternative
- If no requirement, phase out over 30 days

**For C-Grade Products:**
- Reduce par levels by 30%
- Monitor for 60 days
- If doesn't improve to B-grade, discontinue

**For A-Grade Products:**
- Ensure adequate stock levels (prevent stock-outs)
- Consider increasing visibility/placement in kiosks
- These are your profit drivers - protect them

**Your Action Steps:**
1. **Jan 2**: Export all needed data from Odoo
2. **Jan 3-4**: Build profitability spreadsheet
3. **Jan 5**: Import and calculate all metrics
4. **Jan 6-7**: Review and rate all products
5. **Jan 8**: Identify D-grade discontinuation candidates
6. **Jan 9-10**: Review D-grade list, make final decisions
7. **Jan 13-15**: Begin implementing par level changes and discontinuations

**Expected Impact:**
- Eliminate 20-30 unprofitable SKUs
- Reduce waste by $10,000-$15,000/quarter on discontinued items
- Improve overall profit margin by 2-3 percentage points
- Free up capital tied in low-return inventory

**Success Metric:**
- Profitability spreadsheet complete by Jan 5
- All products rated by Jan 8
- At least 15 D-grade products identified for discontinuation by Jan 15

### Action 3.2: Optimize Service Routes and Frequency
**DEADLINE: January 20, 2026**

**Current Situation:**
With 155 locations and limited time/resources, you need optimal routing and service frequency to:
- Reduce waste (more frequent service = fresher products)
- Reduce stock-outs (more frequent service = better availability)
- Reduce your labor costs and drive time

**Specific Actions Required:**

**Step 1: Map Current Routes (Jan 2-5)**

Document your current service pattern:
- Which locations are visited which days?
- How long does each route take?
- How many locations per route?
- What's your current service frequency per location?

**Step 2: Analyze Service Needs by Location (Jan 6-10)**

Create location service tier system:

**Tier 1 - High Service** (3x per week):
- Sales >$60,000/quarter
- High fresh food sales
- High foot traffic, fast turnover
- Examples: Major hotels, large office buildings

**Tier 2 - Standard Service** (2x per week):
- Sales $30,000-$60,000/quarter
- Moderate fresh food sales
- Standard turnover rate

**Tier 3 - Low Service** (1x per week):
- Sales $15,000-$30,000/quarter
- Minimal fresh food
- Slower turnover

**Tier 4 - Minimal Service** (Bi-weekly or as-needed):
- Sales <$15,000/quarter
- Non-perishable focus
- Very low turnover

**Step 3: Redesign Routes for Efficiency (Jan 11-15)**

Using Google Maps or route optimization software:
1. Group locations by geography
2. Assign appropriate service frequency to each location
3. Design routes that minimize drive time
4. Balance route workload (similar hours per route)

**Target Route Design:**
- Route 100: Monday/Thursday - Tier 1 & 2 locations (East region)
- Route 102: Tuesday/Friday - Tier 1 & 2 locations (West region)
- Route 103: Wednesday/Saturday - Tier 1 & 2 locations (Central region)
- Route 104: Wednesday - Tier 3 locations (all regions)
- Route 105: Friday - Tier 4 locations (all regions)

**Step 4: Implement New Routes (Jan 16-20)**

1. Update Odoo with new route assignments
2. Notify all locations of new service schedule
3. Update warehouse picking schedules to match routes
4. Brief any additional staff on new system

**Your Action Steps:**
1. **Jan 2-3**: Document current routes and timing
2. **Jan 4-5**: Calculate current efficiency metrics (locations/hour, drive time %)
3. **Jan 6-8**: Assign service tier to each location
4. **Jan 9-10**: Design optimal routes using mapping software
5. **Jan 11-12**: Calculate new efficiency metrics, compare to current
6. **Jan 13-15**: Refine routes, finalize design
7. **Jan 16-17**: Update Odoo and notify locations
8. **Jan 20**: Begin operating on new routes

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce drive time by 15-20%
- Service high-value locations more frequently (increased sales)
- Reduce waste through better fresh product rotation
- Create more predictable schedule, easier to scale

**Success Metric:**
- New route plan completed by Jan 15
- Routes operational by Jan 20
- 15% reduction in weekly drive time by February

## SECTION 4: STRATEGIC INITIATIVES - 90-DAY IMPLEMENTATION

### Action 4.1: Location-Specific SKU Optimization Program
**TIMELINE: January-March 2026**

**Objective:**
Customize product mix for each location based on actual sales data rather than one-size-fits-all approach.

**Why This Matters:**
Your "Where Sold" data shows products that are top sellers at Location A may never sell at Location B, yet you're stocking them everywhere. This creates waste at B and stock-outs at A.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Month 1 - Data Analysis (January):**

Week 1-2: Analyze top 20 locations
- Identify top 50 SKUs by sales at each location
- Identify SKUs with 0 sales over 90 days
- Calculate location-specific sell-through rates

Week 3-4: Create location profiles
- Hotel locations: profile
- Office building locations: profile  
- Other venue types: profile
- Build standard SKU mixes by location type

**Month 2 - Pilot Program (February):**

Week 1: Select 10 diverse pilot locations

Week 2: Implement customized SKU mix
- Remove zero-sales SKUs
- Add high-performers from similar locations
- Adjust par levels based on velocity

Week 3-4: Monitor results
- Track sales changes
- Track waste changes
- Document learnings

**Month 3 - Rollout (March):**

Week 1-2: Refine approach based on pilot results

Week 3-4: Roll out to next 40 locations
- Implement learnings from pilot
- Monitor and adjust

**Expected Impact:**
- 25-30% reduction in waste at optimized locations
- 15-20% increase in sales (replacing poor sellers with proven sellers)
- Better customer satisfaction (relevant products available)

**Your Deliverables:**
- Jan 31: Location analysis complete, SKU mixes designed
- Feb 28: Pilot complete, results documented
- Mar 31: 50 locations optimized, plan for remaining locations

---

### Action 4.2: Waste Prevention System
**TIMELINE: Ongoing, starting January 2026**

**Current Gap:**
Waste is being tracked AFTER it occurs. You need a system to PREVENT waste before it happens.

**Implementation Plan:**

**Week 1 (Jan 2-6): Build Early Warning System**

Set up in Odoo (or Excel if Odoo limitations):
- Products approaching expiration (7 days out)
- Products with <25% sell-through vs. par level
- Locations with increasing waste trends

**Week 2 (Jan 9-13): Standard Operating Procedures**

Create written procedures for:
1. **Weekly Expiration Review** (every Monday)
   - Pull report of items expiring within 14 days
   - Mark down items expiring within 7 days (50% off)
   - Remove and donate items expiring within 3 days

2. **Bi-Weekly Slow-Mover Review** (1st and 15th of month)
   - Identify SKUs with <2 sales per week
   - Reduce par levels or discontinue
   - Redistribute excess to faster-moving locations

3. **Monthly Waste Pattern Analysis** (last Friday of month)
   - Which products had highest waste?
   - Which locations had highest waste?
   - What actions will prevent repeat next month?

**Weeks 3-4 (Jan 16-31): Train and Implement**

1. Document procedures in simple checklist format
2. Create templates/forms for tracking
3. Schedule recurring tasks in your calendar
4. Begin following procedures religiously

**Ongoing (February-March):**

- Run weekly expiration reviews every Monday
- Run bi-weekly slow-mover reviews
- Monthly waste analysis every last Friday
- Track waste reduction month-over-month

**Expected Impact:**
- 30-40% reduction in waste within 90 days
- $100,000-$120,000 annual waste savings
- More proactive vs. reactive operations

**Your Deliverables:**
- Jan 6: Early warning reports configured
- Jan 13: SOPs documented
- Jan 31: All procedures operational
- Monthly: Waste analysis report showing trend improvement
