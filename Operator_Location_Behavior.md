# Strategic Report: Operator & Location Behavior Analysis

## 1. Problem Analysis: The "Behavior" Gap
**The Core Issue:** We have identified a pattern of "Weak Discipline" at specific sites. The data proves this is not a demand issue; it is a **behavioral issue**.

### The Symptoms
Certain operators are habitually mismanaging their inventory in three visible ways:

*   **Overfilling:** keeping shelves stuffed "to the brim" all day long, regardless of actual sales.
*   **High Write-Offs:** Consistently throwing away more products than other sites.
*   **Capital Hoarding:** Tying up company money in slow-moving stock that never turns into profit.

### The Affected Sites (The Evidence)
The data highlights these specific locations as the primary offenders.

| Site Name | Observed Behavior | The Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brandt Russell Guthrie** | High "MOR" (Morning) & "EVE" (Evening) Stock + High Shrink %. | **"Blind Stocking."** Filling shelves just to make them look full, not to sell. |
| **Bldg 80 Micro** | Extreme stock overlap. | **"Hoarding."** Keeping inventory "just in case" rather than "just in time." |
| **Westin Long Beach** | High base inventory with low turnover. | **"Stagnation."** Stock sits still, gathering dust and cost. |

**The Root Cause:**
This is **Weak Process Discipline.**
*   Over-Ordering (Ordering 50 when you sold 10).
*   Poor Rotation (New milk goes in front of old milk).
*   Poor Security (High-shrink items left unguarded).

## 2. The Solution: "Rules & Tools"
We cannot specific "hope" for better behavior. We must **enforce** it with clear rules and tracking tools.

### Strategy 1: Audits & Locks (The Control)
For the high-risk operators identified above, we implement stricter controls immediately.

| Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Audits** | Move from Monthly -> **Weekly** checks. If they know we are watching, behavior changes. |
| **Physical Locks** | Install product/door locks for the high-shrink SKUs (e.g., Electronics, Expensive Energy Drinks). |
| **Enforce FEFO** | **"First Expiring, First Out."** Mandatory checks to ensure old stock is sold before new stock. |

### Strategy 2: Ordering Discipline (The Rules)
We remove the "guesswork" from ordering.

*   **Rule #1: The "FSN" Tie-in:** You cannot order a "Slow" item if you already have > 8 weeks of supply. The system should block it.
*   **Rule #2: The Cap:** "Do not exceed **X Days** of stock." (e.g., No more than 10 days of Chips).
*   **Rule #3: Priority:** "Always fill **FAST** items first." Spend the budget on what sells.

### Strategy 3: The Scorecard (The Accountability)
We build a simple "Report Card" for every operator to track their improvement.

| Metric | Goal | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MOR Stock Level** | **< 65%** | Proves they are not over-stuffing shelves. |
| **Shrink %** | **< 2%** | Proves they are rotating stock and stopping theft. |
| **Sales Growth** | **Positive (+)** | Proves they are focusing on the right items (Fast Movers). |

**The Outcome:** Management can instantly seeing "Who is winning" and "Who needs coaching."
