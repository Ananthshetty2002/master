# Shrinkage & Risk Analysis: The Full Story

## Report Highlights
Here is the simple truth about our money. We are losing it, and we can stop it.

*   **The Main Problem:** We lose over **$1,000 every day** because of three simple things:
    *   **Shrinkage:** Items missing or used, but not paid for.
    *   **Waste:** We buy food that rots.
    *   **Lost Sales:** We run out of milk by lunch.

*   **The "Loss" Story:**
    *   **The Fact:** A few people (like **Rony Perez**) are linked to ~$90/day in missing items.
    *   **The Cause:** They think "nobody counts the stock," so mistakes happen.
    *   **The Danger:** 269 other staff are watching. If they start being careless too, we will lose an extra **$454,970**.
    *   **The Fix:** Check Rony's stock every day. He will stop making mistakes.

*   **The "Waste" Story:**
    *   **The Mistake:** Westin trashes 10 cartons of milk daily. Bldg80 has none.
    *   **The Fix:** Don't buy more. Just move the extra milk from Westin to Bldg80.

*   **The Result:** These two fixes will save us nearly **$500,000** this year.

## Part 1: The Bucket Problem
Think of our business as a bucket of water. We pour water (sales) in the top. But the bucket has holes. Money is leaking out.

We found two big holes:
1.  **Missing Items:** Food is eaten or taken without a record.
2.  **Rotting Food:** We buy too much food that nobody eats.

**Total Loss:** Over **$1,000 every single day**.

---

## Part 1.5: The Root Causes
It comes down to three simple things:

1.  **Money Loss:**
    *   **Items Missing:** Taken without being paid for.
    *   **Spoilage:** Buying food that expires before we can sell it.

2.  **Ordering Mistakes:**
    *   **Overstock:** Buying more than we can sell (leads to waste).
    *   **Understock:** Running out of popular items (leads to angry customers).
    *   **Wrong Mix:** Ordering the same for every store, even though Westin is busy and Brandt is quiet.

3.  **Process Gaps:**
    *   **Bad Rotation:** Putting new stock in front of old stock. The old stock rots in the back.
    *   **No Sharing:** One store has too much milk, another has none. We don't move it.

---

## Part 2: The "Missing Items" Story
Where is the stock going? We looked at the data.

### The "Rony Perez" Example
One employee, **Rony Perez**, works at Westin.
*   **What we see:** When Rony works, items worth **$90** go missing every day.
*   **Why?** It is likely a mistake. He thinks no one checks the stock. so he is not careful.
*   **The Cost:** This one issue costs us **$11,465+**.

| Staff to Watch | Risk | The Cost | The Lesson |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rony Perez** | **HIGH** | **$11,465+** | If we don't check, stock goes missing. |
| **Elmer Mancia** | **HIGH** | **$3,254** | We know exactly where to look. |
| **Edward Smedley** | **HIGH** | **$3,023** | We can fix this easily. |

## Part 3: The Hidden Danger
This is the big risk. Most staff currently have very small losses (~$100). We ignore them.

### Careful staff become Careless staff
1.  The "Careful" staff watch **Rony**.
2.  They see Rony has $90/day in missing stock.
3.  They see that **nothing happens to Rony**.
4.  They think: *"I don't need to be careful either."*

### The Cost of being Careless
If everyone stops being careful, the cost explodes.

*   **High Risk Group:** They have already reached the limit. The cost cannot go higher.
*   **Medium Group (111 people):** If they become as careless as Rony, they lose **$943 more** each.
    *   *Math:* 111 people × $943 = **$104,654** loss.
*   **Low Risk Group (269 people):** If they become careless, they lose **$1,302 more** each.
    *   *Math:* 269 people × $1,302 = **$350,316** loss.

**Total Future Risk:** **$454,970**. We must act now.

| Group | Count | Current Loss | Max Risk | Added Cost |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **High Risk** | 68 | ~$1,402 | ~$1,402 | $0 |
| **Medium Risk** | 111 | ~$459 | ~$1,402 | +$104,654 |
| **Low Risk** | 269 | ~$100 | ~$1,402 | +$350,316 |
| **TOTAL** | **448** | **~$387** | **-** | **+$454,970** |

## Part 4: Waste Problem (Reality)
We are losing about **$605/day** to food waste (spoilage) across Westin, Bldg80, and Brandt.​

**Root cause:** Westin over‑stocks, while other sites either run short or quietly let stock expire.

**8‑week Transaction List** shows that at Westin each “problem SKU” actually sells about 1–1.4 units per day, not 5–10.

**Example daily averages at Westin (8‑week data):**

*   **Milk Shamrock Lowfat 7oz (PC10997):** 1.36/day
*   **Lunchables Turkey & Cheddar (PC10762):** 1.16/day
*   **Schweppe’s Ginger Ale 20oz (AVR00149):** 1.14/day
*   **Mountain Diet Dew 20oz (AVR09658):** 1.03/day
*   **Fairlife & Muscle Milks (AVR18526, AVR27451, AVR27452):** ≈1.05–1.12/day
*   **FR SLB turkey sandwiches (AVR26220/225/226):** ≈1.0–1.03/day

Today, these often sit in coolers in larger quantities “by habit”, which is why they show up in spoilage logs.

### Data-Driven Par Levels (Westin)
From these averages, the new Westin par sheet is:

| Product Code | Product Desc | Avg units/day | New Par (units in cooler) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PC10997 | Milk Shamrock Lowfat 7oz | 1.36 | 2 |
| PC10762 | Lunchables Turkey & Cheddar | 1.16 | 2 |
| AVR00149 | Schweppe’s Ginger Ale 20oz | 1.14 | 2 |
| AVR09658 | Mountain Diet Dew 20oz | 1.03 | 2 |
| AVR18526 | Fairlife Chocolate Milk 14oz | 1.07 | 2 |
| AVR27451 | Muscle Milk Chocolate 14oz | 1.12 | 2 |
| AVR27452 | Muscle Milk Vanilla 14oz | 1.05 | 2 |
| AVR26226 | FR SLB Triangle Turkey Wheat | 1.03 | 2 |
| AVR26225 | FR SLB Sub Turkey & Cheese | 1.00 | 2 |
| AVR26220 | FR SLB Multigrain Turkey & Bacon Club | 1.00 | 2 |

**Rule for Westin manager (laminated sheet):**

> “For these 10 SKUs, keep 2 in the cooler. If you see more than 2, do not load more; move extras to another site or leave in back stock.”

This matches real sales and immediately cuts over‑stocking.

## Part 5: Site Action Plan (Aligned with PDF)

### Westin Long Beach (high traffic)​

*   **Use the par sheet above:** (2 units each for key milk/turkey/ginger/dew SKUs).
*   **Rotation:** move oldest milk, Ginger Ale, Diet Dew, and yogurt/protein milks from back → front daily so the 2 on display are always the oldest stock.
*   **Result:** Westin stops wasting slow‑moving units that used to sit in back coolers and hit expiry.

### Bldg80 (excess turkey, milk shortages)​

*   **Turkey:** When on‑hand is well above its own average, send up to 50 units to Westin in the morning (as in your example), instead of letting them expire.
*   **Milk:** Receive Westin’s extra units when Westin is above par; Bldg80 sells them instead of buying new.
*   **Yogurt/drinks:** Use the same 8‑week logic to set Bldg80’s own pars and take Westin’s extras when needed.

### Brandt Russell Guthrie (quiet site, weekend rot)​

*   **Milk:** Order less (for example, 12/day in your PDF example) and enforce rotation so weekend stock does not rot.
*   **Yogurt:** Order around 18 Mon–Fri if that matches its 8‑week average; do not load more.
*   **Turkey:** Receive limited units (e.g., 20) from Bldg80 only when Brandt’s forecast justifies it.

## Part 6: Money Impact (same as PDF, now with backing)

*   **Rotting Food:** Moving excess milk/turkey from quiet/over‑stocked sites to busy sites and cutting pars to match real demand can save about **$220,000/year**.​
*   **Empty Shelves:** Filling gaps with that same excess stock (instead of ordering wrong items) can unlock about **$160,000/year** in sales.​
*   **Missing Stock (shrinkage):** Daily audits of HIGH‑risk operators reduce another **~$175,000/year**.​

**Total potential impact remains ~$500,000/year saved**, but now your Transaction List tables show exactly which SKUs at Westin justify pars of 2 instead of big piles in the cooler.
