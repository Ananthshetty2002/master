# Strategy Report: "FSN Analysis" (Fast-Slow-Non-moving)

## 1. Deep Dive: 3-Sector Problem Analysis
We analyzed our entire inventory and stuck every item into one of three "Sectors". All three have a unique problem.

### Sector 1: The "Slow" Sector (Overstock)
*   **Definition:** Items that have **> 8 Weeks of Supply**.
*   **The Problem:** **"Dead Cash."**
    *   We bought too much based on bad forecasts.
    *   The food sits on the shelf collecting dust.
    *   **The Risk:** It will expire before it sells. We essentially paid for trash.
    *   *Example:* *Westin Pasadena* has 13 weeks of sandwiches.

### Sector 2: The "Fast" Sector (Understock)
*   **Definition:** Items that sell out in **< 3 Days**.
*   **The Problem:** **"Empty Shelves."**
    *   Demand is higher than we thought.
    *   Customers enter the store to buy, find nothing, and leave angry.
    *   **The Risk:** We lose the sale today, and we lose the customer forever (they stop coming back).
    *   *Example:* *Comfort Inn Huntington* runs out of Disney Toys by Friday.

### Sector 3: The "Non-Moving" Sector (Dead Weight)
*   **Definition:** Items that have sold **Zero Units** in 4 weeks.
*   **The Problem:** **"Wasted Space."**
    *   Customers simply do not want this item.
    *   It takes up valuable prime shelf space that could be holding a "Fast" item.
    *   **The Risk:** It is invisible blockage in our supply chain.

## 2. The Solution: Inter-site Redistribution
We do not use a "one size fits all" solution. We treat each sector differently.

### Solution for Sector 1 (Slow) -> **"TRANSFER"**
*   **Action:** Stop ordering more immediately.
*   **The Fix:** Teleport the existing stock to a "Fast" store.
*   **Why:** It clears the liability from the Slow store's books without throwing it away.

### Solution for Sector 2 (Fast) -> **"RESTOCK via TRANSFER"**
*   **Action:** Do not wait for a vendor delivery.
*   **The Fix:** Receive the "free" stock from the Slow store today.
*   **Why:** It fills the shelves instantly (Same Day) and costs $0 in new inventory purchases.

### Solution for Sector 3 (Non-Moving) -> **"KILL & REPLACE"**
*   **Action:** Remove the item tag from the shelf.
*   **The Fix:**
    1.  Discount the item 50% to clear it out.
    2.  Once gone, fill the empty spot with a "Fast" sector item.
*   **Why:** We trade a loser product for a winner product. Revenue per square foot goes up.

## 3. The "FSN" Model Explained
We categorize every single item in our stores into three buckets.

| Category | Name | The Definition | The Action Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F** | **FAST** | Sells quickly. Runs out often. | **Restock Immediately.** (Use transfers from Slow stores). |
| **S** | **SLOW** | Sells slowly. Stock > 8 weeks. | **Stop Ordering.** Transfer excess to Fast stores. |
| **N** | **NON-MOVING** | hasn't sold in 4+ weeks. | **Kill Item.** Remove from planogram. Do not buy again. |

## 4. Financial & Operational Impact
Moving stock is cheap. Wasting stock is expensive.

**Cost vs Benefit Analysis:**

| Item | The "Old Way" (Do Nothing) | The "New Way" (Transfer) | The Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Waste Bill** | We throw away ~$357 / day in spoiled food. | We reduce waste to ~$50 / day. | **Save ~$300 / day** |
| **Sales Revenue** | We start missing sales by 11:00 AM. | We sell all day long. | **Gain ~$450 / day** |
| **Transfer Cost** | $0 (But we lose $800+ in value). | ~$63 (Truck & Driver). | **Net Profit: ~$700+** |

**Conclusion:** Spending $63 to save/make $800 is a "no-brainer" investment.

## 5. Execution Steps (Simple Workflow)
How we make this happen without confusing the staff.

1.  **IDENTIFY (The Data):**
    *   We run the weekly report.
    *   We flag any item with **> 8 Weeks of Supply** at a specific store.
2.  **MATCH (The Logistics):**
    *   We look for a **Fast Store** nearby (e.g. *Huntington Beach*) that sells that exact item.
3.  **TRANSFER (The Action):**
    *   We create a transfer order.
    *   Driver moves the stock (e.g. 60 units of Disney Toys).
4.  **RESULT (The Win):**
    *   Slow store shelves are clear. Fast store shelves are full.

## 6. Real World Example
*   **Item:** Disney Toys & Jerky.
*   **Problem:** *Motel 6 Anaheim* had 9 weeks of supply (Way too much).
*   **Problem:** *Comfort Inn Huntington* had 0 weeks of supply (Sold out).
*   **Action:** Transferred 60 units on Tuesday.
*   **Outcome:** All 60 units sold at Comfort Inn within 5 days. Zero waste.
